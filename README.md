## T-MON

**T-MON** is an open-source framework designed to reduce the cybersecurity skills shortage by providing aspiring cybersecurity professionals a roadmap to identify and build relevant skills, employers a mechanism to evaluate the skills of their existing and potential employees and the cybersecurity community an opportunity to contribute to this cause.


## Philosophy

Today, the biggest challenges for aspiring and existing cybersecurity professionals all across the world are:

1) Identification of all the cybersecurity skills required specific to each role

2) A roadmap for the development of these skills

3) Non-existence of a mechanism to evaluate these skills

**T-MON** is an open source framework launched with an aim of developing a benchmark to guide cybersecurity aspirants and enthusiasts by providing them a clear pathway of the tactics and techniques they need to learn in order to jump start and take their career to the next level. Since, attack prediction, prevention, detection, and response are the core competencies of a cybersecurity professional. Through T-MON, we aim to develop these cybersecurity attack focused capabilities and solve the global challenge of cybersecurity skill shortage through interactive and challenge based skill development courses. We have aligned T-MON with other community led projects such as [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) Framework and [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) to provide a robust and pragmatic scheme of studies. We have kept the framework open source so that everyone can easily have access to this framework and contributors from all across the world can play their part in solving these global challenges. With an objective to collaborate, work together and aid mutual nurturing of cybersecurity professionals of the future and ultimately, reducing the cybersecurity skill shortage, we encourage all seasoned cybersecurity professionals to contribute and play their part for this cause and as a token of appreciation, we will be sending branded T-MON merchandise to every single contributor.

Through **T-MON** we also aim to provide employers with a mechanism to evaluate the skills of their potential employees. Additionally, for existing employees we can carry out a comprehensive maturity assessment and design specialized workshops to cost effectively develop the skillset of their existing employees.

## Approach

With constantly evolving cyber threats, a mentality of preventing all breaches is obsolete. Thus, cybersecurity experts not only need to be prepared to respond and react to threats, but also develop proactive skills, including, penetration testing, and red teaming tactics. Keeping this in mind, TMON is developed as a multi-perspective focus (predict-prevent-detect-respond) platform, to instill the skills vital to protect systems against specific threats, coupled with ongoing offensive activity. T-MON employs a vast array of learning assets from a plethora of sources for each segment, allowing users to customize and navigate through the curriculum as they see fit to aid self-paced learning. Realistic scenarios in simulated environments featuring the latest attacker tools, tactics and procedures (TTPs)

## About T-MON

**T-MON** is inspired by the Disney © character [Timon](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Timon), a meerkat who took a weak and dejected Simba under his wing and made him realize his true potential of leading the Pride Lands, likewise, we aspire to do the same. Just like a meerkat on the hunt, T-MON is focused on helping the cybersecurity experts become the ultimate predators, rendering the adversaries powerless. Meerkat’s philosophy is to out think, out wit and out play the adversaries and we seek to develop the same philosophy by helping you master these meerkat traits:

**Speed and Agility** – Pragmatic cybersecurity is all about swiftness; rapid response, and prompt reaction is the only defense, information streams and corporate data assets have. Preemptively detect, and respond to the threats, acting before they become a menace.

**Stay on your toes** – Stand primed against any attack, at any time.

**Resilience** – Attack will happen no matter how protected you are. Absolute cybersecurity is a euphoric dream, unachievable due to the rapid pace of development in the technological word. Learn to stay one step ahead, and resilient; like a mongoose, withstanding venomous serpents, and recuperating quickly against them.

**Composure** - Stay composed against adversity, keeping your focus on the prize at all times.

**Diversity** - Diversity is perseverance. Branch out your skillset to be better prepared against modern day cyber-hostilities.

**Nondiscriminatory predators** – Every attack is equally detrimental to your security. Adversaries don’t distinguish, neither should you.

**Persistence** – Cybersecurity experts need to be persistent to predict, prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents in an effective and timely manner.
